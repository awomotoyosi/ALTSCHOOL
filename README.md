# My ALTSCHOOL Profile

## Description

This project includes:

This project showcases my assignments from the ALTSCHOOL program. It is divided into two main parts:

1.   HTML_ASSIGNMENT: A simple webpage that highlights my ALTSCHOOL profile, including sections for my biography, reasons for        joining ALTSCHOOL, and goals. Additionally, I have replicated the ALTSCHOOL signup page and created a page displaying           ALTSCHOOL courses. Finally, a media page featuring images, audio, and video is included. All of these sections are linked       through a global navigation menu, creating a seamless user experience.

2.   CSS_ASSIGNMENT: This section contains six assignments that involve mimicking different images on a webpage using CSS. Each      assignment is stored in a separate folder, with each folder containing an HTML file and a corresponding CSS file for            styling.
